# Pothole-detection
As part of our EE461 ( Special topics in Electrical and Electronics Engineering ) a real time pothole detection system will be created which will utilize computer vision and machine learning.
The dataset used will be the ones available online and a custom dataset of potholes on Fijian road.
Upon training and validation of models it will be deployed onto a raspberry pi for real-time detection.
